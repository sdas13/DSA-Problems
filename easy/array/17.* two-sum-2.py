"""
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
